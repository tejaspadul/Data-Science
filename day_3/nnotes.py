1. List

A list is an ordered collection of elements.

It is mutable, meaning elements can be added, removed, or modified.

It allows duplicate values.

Elements are stored with an index (0-based).

Used when you need a dynamic collection that can grow or shrink.

Common operations: inserting, deleting, slicing, updating, sorting, and searching.

2. Tuple

A tuple is an ordered collection of elements.

It is immutable, meaning once created, it cannot be changed.

It allows duplicate values.

Elements can be accessed by indexing, but not modified.

Often used when data should remain constant throughout the program.

Provides faster access compared to lists due to immutability.

3. Set

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

It is mutable, meaning elements can be added or removed, but elements themselves must be immutable.

Does not allow duplicates.

Since sets are unordered, they do not support indexing or slicing.

Commonly used for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Useful when you want to store only distinct items.

4. Dictionary

A dictionary is a collection of keyâ€“value pairs.

Keys are unique and immutable, while values can be duplicated and mutable.

It is mutable, so elements can be added, updated, or deleted.

Provides fast access to values using keys instead of indexes.

Often used to represent structured data (like records or objects).

Supports nesting, meaning dictionaries can contain other dictionaries or lists.

6. Practice Programs

Store 5 numbers in a list and print their sum.

Create a tuple of fruits and access them using slicing.

Use sets to find common students in two different classes.

Make a dictionary of 3 students with names as keys and marks as values, then find the student with the highest marks.

7. Mini Project (Day 3)

Student Management (Basic Version)

Store student info in a dictionary inside a list.

Each student has: Name, Roll No, Marks.

Add 3 students and display them in proper format.
